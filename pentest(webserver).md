# Web Server Penetration Testing Guide (Authorized Testing)

> ⚠️ **Legal Notice**  
> Perform penetration testing **only** on systems you own or have **explicit written permission** to test.

---

## 1. Scope & Preparation

- Define target(s): domain, IPs, subdomains
- Identify testing type:
  - Black box
  - Gray box
  - White box
- Confirm:
  - Allowed attack types
  - Testing window
  - Reporting requirements
- Gather documentation and credentials (if provided)

---

## 2. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

### 2.1 Passive Recon
- Identify:
  - Domain information
  - DNS records
  - Hosting provider
  - Public IP ranges
- Enumerate:
  - Subdomains
  - Technologies
  - Public endpoints

**Focus:** No interaction with target systems

---

### 2.2 Active Recon
- Identify live hosts
- Detect:
  - Web servers
  - Open ports
  - Running services
- Fingerprint:
  - Web server type
  - Frameworks
  - CMS
  - Languages

---

## 3. Enumeration

### 3.1 Web Application Mapping
- Crawl the application
- Identify:
  - Routes and parameters
  - Forms and inputs
  - File uploads
  - Authentication points
  - APIs

---

### 3.2 Technology Enumeration
- Web server version
- Framework versions
- Third-party libraries
- CMS plugins/modules

---

## 4. Vulnerability Analysis

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization
- Weak passwords
- Default credentials
- Missing MFA
- Broken access control
- Privilege escalation paths

---

### 4.2 Input Validation
- Injection risks:
  - SQL Injection
  - Command Injection
  - LDAP Injection
- Client-side validation bypass
- Unsanitized parameters

---

### 4.3 Session Management
- Session fixation
- Insecure cookies
- Missing flags:
  - Secure
  - HttpOnly
  - SameSite
- Token predictability

---

### 4.4 File Handling
- Arbitrary file upload
- Path traversal
- Local/Remote File Inclusion
- Backup and config file exposure

---

### 4.5 Business Logic
- Workflow bypass
- Price manipulation
- Rate limiting issues
- Function abuse

---

### 4.6 API Security
- Broken object level authorization
- Mass assignment
- Excessive data exposure
- Missing authentication

---

## 5. Configuration & Infrastructure

- Security headers:
  - CSP
  - HSTS
  - X-Frame-Options
- TLS configuration
- Directory listing
- Debug mode enabled
- Exposed admin panels

---

## 6. Exploitation (Proof of Concept)

> Goal: **Demonstrate impact safely**

- Validate vulnerabilities
- Avoid destructive payloads
- Capture:
  - Request/response evidence
  - Screenshots
  - Logs

---

## 7. Post-Exploitation

- Assess impact:
  - Data exposure
  - Account compromise
  - Privilege escalation
- Identify pivot opportunities (if in scope)
- Maintain minimal footprint

---

## 8. Reporting

### 8.1 Executive Summary
- Overall security posture
- Risk level
- Key findings

### 8.2 Technical Findings
For each issue:
- Title
- Severity (CVSS)
- Description
- Impact
- Reproduction steps
- Evidence
- Remediation guidance

---

## 9. Remediation Verification

- Retest fixed issues
- Confirm no regressions
- Update report status

---

## 10. Best Practices

- Follow OWASP Top 10
- Use least privilege
- Patch regularly
- Enable logging & monitoring
- Implement WAF
- Perform regular security testing
